Lists, sometimes called arrays, are used to store ordered sequences of items.

For example, to create a list of numbers, try the following into your terminal:

```python
>>> numbers = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

We can access those numbers by its index, starting from 0:

```python
>>> numbers = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
>>> numbers[0]
2
>>> numbers[1]
4
>>> numbers[2]
6
>>> numbers[3]
8
>>> numbers[4]
10
```

(in code, we always start counting from 0)
