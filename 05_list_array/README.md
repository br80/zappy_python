Lists, sometimes called arrays, are used to store ordered sequences of items.

For example, to create a list of numbers, type this into your Python terminal:

```python
>>> numbers = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```

We can access those numbers by its index, starting from 0:

```python
>>> numbers = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
>>> numbers     # Show me the list
[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
>>> numbers[0]  # The first item, index 0
2
>>> numbers[1]  # The second item, index 1
4
>>> numbers[2]  # The third item, index 2
6
>>> numbers[3]  # The fourth item, index 3
8
>>> numbers[4]  # The fifth item, index 4
10
```

(In code, we always count from 0.)
