# Python

Python is an amazing programming language.

Clean and simple, it is an ideal beginning programming language. Powerful and flexible, it is the primary tool of choice for millions of researchers, data scientists, web developers, hackers and more.

In this video series, we will be covering all the basics you need to get started with Python code. By the end, you'll be able to read and write the code to build a simple graphical adventure game:

## Is this series for you?

Are you a fast learner, new to programming and looking for the shortest path to making cool games? This series is for you.

Are you studying programming in school but bored building todo lists and calculators? This series is for you.

Are you experienced in another programming language but curious about the power, flexibility and fun of Python? This series is for you.

## What will you learn?


## Text Editor and Terminal

You'll want a code-based text editor to read and write code. I recommend [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/) for Mac and Linux, or [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for Windows.

You'll also want to start getting used to your computer's Command Line Interface. Mac and Linux come bundled with the Terminal program by default while VSCode comes with a built-in command line.


## Installing Python

You'll need to have Python 3 installed for this series.

### Mac

1. Open a Terminal window on your Mac.

2. Install `brew` via the instructions on the [Homebrew website](https://brew.sh/).

3. Install Python via brew by typing `brew install python` in your Terminal.

4. Test your Python install by typing `python3 --version` in your Terminal. It should return version 3.6 or greater.

### Windows

1. Download the latest Python from the [Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/).

2. Check `[ ] Add to PATH` when prompted by the installer.

3. Open VSCode and click `New Terminal` from the toolbar.

4. Type `python --version` in the Terminal. It should return version 3.6 or greater.

### Linux

This can vary by Linux distribution. Check the docs! Your distro may come with Python 3 by default.
